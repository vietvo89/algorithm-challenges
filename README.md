## Algorithm challenges

21-days Challenge to study akgorithms:
- Day 1, 2: Big 0 (Chapter 6 - Cracking the Coding Interview/ Chapter 2 - The Algorithm Design Manual)
    - Time Complexity: 
        - Big O (UB), Big Theta (In between) and Big Omega (LB).
        - Best case, worst case and expected case.
    - Space Complexity
    - Drop the constants
    - Drop the non-dominant terms
    - Multiparts: Add vs Multiply
    - Amortize time? (not well understand)
    - Log N runtimes
    - Recursive runtimes?
- Day 3:
